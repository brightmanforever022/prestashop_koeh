             Shipping priority is calculated by following rules:<br>
-            Common rule is that earlier order should be shipped earlier, products are reserved for order even if it is not paid yet.
+            Common rule is that earlier order should be shipped earlier, products are reserved for order even if it is not paid yet.<br/>
+            We calculate quantity of products available to fulfil current ordered item and show this quantity as "avail for ship".<br/>
+            Here is formulas by which we calculate this quantity:<br>
+            physQty = avail(db stock) + notShippedKoehlert + notShippedDbk  -- quantity physically presenting in our wirehouse (part in vipdress, part in dbk)<br>
+            avForCurAndBelow = physQty - sumQtyOfHigherPriorityOrders(dbk preorders+koehlert) -- available for ship in current order and in orders below by priority<br>
+            avForCurAndBelow = avail(db stock) + notShippedDbkCurAndBelow + notShippiedKhlCurAndBelow <br>
+            if avForCurAndBelow<=0 it means we need to ship -avForCurAndBelow items first (in higher priority orders) to start to fulfil current order<br>
+            if avForCurAndBelow<=0, then we need to look in supplier orders. To understand that supplier order may be used for current order we calculate following:<br>
+            supOrderOffset = sum of all earlier orders + curSupOrderQty -- position of supplier order in supplier order queue<br>
+            What supplier order can be used to fulfil current order? :<br>
+            1. All that have supOrderOffset > -avForCurAndBelow -- other words supOrderOffset fulfils all higher priority orders<br>
+            2. There may be many such supplier orders. We need to take from supplier orders only ordered quantity for current order. I.e. we don't need supplier orders
+            that start from offset greater, then we need to fulfil current order:
+            supOrderOffset - soOrdered > -(avForCurAndBelow - ordered), we need:
+supOrderOffset - soOrdered <= -(avForCurAndBelow - ordered)
